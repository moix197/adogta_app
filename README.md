This is just a part of the frontend of a personal project I'm working on at the moment,
it's a dog adopting app, is very basic right now, but I'm just starting with it,
you can download the code and use it if you want, it can comes handy for any kind of app
that needs to show a map and items, kind of "airbnb" type.
There's a google map api key added to the project, it's just for testing purposes, if you
plan on using the code, please get your own, also have in mind that all your api keys should be
in a separate config file or similar.

if you have any doubt, questions, or wanna be part of the project, feel fre to <a href="mailto:moix197@gmail.com">email me</a>
